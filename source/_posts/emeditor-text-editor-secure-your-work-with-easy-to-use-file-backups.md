Hi!  
 Is it possible to have File-Backups depending on Projects?  
 E.g I have Project “Fubar” with files like r:projectsFubarsrcfoo.lua and I would like to have my Backup-Files for that in r:projectsFubarbakfoo.lua.bak  
 On an other project “Kerfuffle” I’ll have a layout r:projectskerfufflesrcblabber.lua and with expected backup-files in r:projectskerfufflebakblabber.lua.bak  
 I found only a “Backup” in the Configuration-Dialog, but that seems to be for all Files concertning that Type, oder is it possible to have some Wildcards in the “Backup Folder”, didnt found that.  
 Sure I could use my svn and check my files always in, but at my point of view that is not necessary.  
 cheers

Hello Matthias,  
 Thank you for using EmEditor!  
 I might consider more sophisticated backup settings in future versions. Thank you!

Hi!  
 Thanks for your fast reply, would be great to see something like that in a future release.  
 Another question, would it be possible to “selfmodify” the configuration?  
 I mean, if I remember right, sorry still a newbie with emeditor, I save my macros with my project, or my “solution”, still not quite familiar with that dependencies and naming.  
 So I could write a macro which sets a new BackupDirectory for every “project” I have and fire it up if I load that project, modify my settings and would have a little bit tricky workaround.  
 Fiction or would that be a possible way, hehehe didnt say that would simple ;-) ?  
 cheers

You can write a macro to change backup settings.  
 This is just an example how you write that macro:  
cfg = document.Config;  
	cfg.Backup.SaveToFolder = true;  
	cfg.Backup.Folder = "C:BackupFolder";  
	cfg.Save();  
	 Please let me know if you have further questions.  
 Thanks!
