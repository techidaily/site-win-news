Just come across the webpage on EmEditor 7\. I’m anxiously waiting for it:  
[http://www.emeditor.com/modules/feature1/rewrite/tc\_6.html](https://tools.techidaily.com/emeditor/products/)  
 \* EmEditor can now record and play keystrokes and mouse operation against other applications.  
 Seems like EmEditor is getting out of its traditional domain and getting into automation. Perhaps I should dump AutoHotKey and use EmEditor for macros and automation. AutoHotKey’s properitary scripting language is crappy anyway.  
 \* You can now have an option to save all settings to INI files instead of the Registry.  
 Love it. Now I can do proper backup.  
 \* Optimized to Open Large Files  
 Can’t wait. Does it work on networked drive too?  
 \* The virtual space mode.  
 I have waited for this for so long.  
 Great work! I’m really looking forward for the upgrade!

Don’t tease us, just release it. Using pseudo-specific terms like “…will be released soon” tends too frustrate people if the release is not imminent.  
 Impatiently waiting for a stable v7 release,

I can probably release beta versions in a few weeks. I apologize if the term “soon” was not specific enough and confusing. I can only say that the new version will be released when it becomes stable enough. I don’t want to release versions that might contain too many bugs. I work very hard, day and night, to finalize Version 7\. I committed to make it one of the greatest updates in the EmEditor history! Thank you very much for your support!

 How does one obtain beta versions? Is there a formal beta testing forum in which one can post bugs?
